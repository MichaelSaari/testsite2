		If You Forget Me
		I want you to know
		one thing.

		You know how this is:
		if I look
		at the crystal moon, at the red branch
		of the slow autumn at my window,
		if I touch
		near the fire
		the impalpable ash
		or the wrinkled body of the log,
		everything carries me to you,
		as if everything that exists,
		aromas, light, metals,
		were little boats
		that sail
		toward those isles of yours that wait for me.

		Well, now,
		if little by little you stop loving me
		I shall stop loving you little by little.

		If suddenly
		you forget me
		do not look for me,
		for I shall already have forgotten you.

		If you think it long and mad,
		the wind of banners
		that passes through my life,
		and you decide
		to leave me at the shore
		of the heart where I have roots,
		remember
		that on that day,
		at that hour,
		I shall lift my arms
		and my roots will set off
		to seek another land.

		But
		if each day,
		each hour,
		you feel that you are destined for me
		with implacable sweetness,
		if each day a flower
		climbs up to your lips to seek me,
		ah my love, ah my own,
		in me all that fire is repeated,
		in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
		my love feeds on your love, beloved,
		and as long as you live it will be in your arms
		without leaving mine.
